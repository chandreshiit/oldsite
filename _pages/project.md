1. **Multimodal incident similarity inference for improving ticket resolution**   
(In collaboration with IBM Research and IIIT Gwalior, India)  
we look at the problem of multimodal incident similarity inference with the objective of improving the incident management process by automatically suggesting resolutions from similar tickets. While text is still the primary mode of communicating the incidents, there is a growing trend of using alternate modalities like image and video to communicate the problem in an incident. A large fraction of IT support tickets today contain attached image data in the form of screenshots, log messages, invoices and so on. These attachments help in better explanation of the problem which aids in faster resolution.Most of the existing literature on incident similarity has looked at only text based similarity which is no longer sufficient. Recently some work has been done on Visual Question Answering (VQA) which uses cross-modal inferencing [1][2]. In particular the work in [1] uses attention between question text and image features as well as attention between question text and text from image. However it remains to be seen how much of this work is relevant in the incident management domain as the VQA model is trained on natural images and scene text images which are widely different from images obtained from IT support incidents. For incident images, we need to detect and recognise object and text present in the image and establish relation with question text for better question understanding.
2. **Feature/Suggestion recommendation based on crowd-source data**  
(In collaboration with NIT Shilong, India, IBM Research and NTNU Norway)  
we are building  a model which can recommend the features/suggestions for improvement of the product/services based on crowd-source data. The challenge which lies ahead in this is to solve various NLP problems such as summarization, sarcasm detection, class-imbalance learning, semantic-clustering to new a few. We are looking at the state-of-the-art solution in the literature to build upon and to improve the existing system. The model will be useful to product developers, service managers to roll out new features for their products/services to gain competitive advantage.

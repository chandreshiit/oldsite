**Research interests**: More broadly, I am interested in designing algorithms and models for processing big data. My work has been around in machine learning, data mining during my Ph.D. During my stint at IBM, I have started working in text mining and natural language processing using deep learning. My current research is around designing deep architectures for understanding natural language.
